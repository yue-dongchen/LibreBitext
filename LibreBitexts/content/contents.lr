The LibreBitexts project assembles bitexts (parallel texts) from public domain sources and makes them available under a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), with the aim of eventually building a sizeable collection of various works between a plethora of language pairs. 

Go to the ["Texts"](texts) page for downloads. Texts are currently available in A4 PDF format. To contribute, contact [Dongchen Yue](https://linksta.cc/@yue-dongchen).
